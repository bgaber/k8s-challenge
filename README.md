# k8s-challenge
Kubernetes Resume Challenge 2024

The objective of this challenge was to similate the deployment an e-commerce website. For this project it was crucial to consider the challenges of modern web application deployment and how containerization and Kubernetes (K8s) offer compelling solutions:

- Scalability: How can application automatically adjust to fluctuating traffic?
- Consistency: How to ensure application runs the same across all environments?
- Availability: How to configure application with zero downtime?

Containerization, using Docker, encapsulates your application and its environment, ensuring it runs consistently everywhere. Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform, automates deployment, scaling, and management, offering:

- Dynamic Scaling: Adjusts application resources based on demand.
- Self-healing: Restarts failed containers and reschedules them on healthy nodes.
- Seamless Updates & Rollbacks: Enables zero-downtime updates and easy rollbacks.

By leveraging Kubernetes and containerization a scalable, consistent, and resilient deployment strategy is embraced. This not only demonstrates technical acumen but aligns with modern DevOps practices.
